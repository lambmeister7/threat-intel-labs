# 🧠 Modern Threat Matrix – 2025 Edition

This simulation identifies and breaks down **10 real-world threats** affecting financial systems, critical infrastructure, and enterprise environments in 2025.

Each threat is evaluated using:
- 🟥 Likelihood & Impact scoring (heatmap)
- 🔐 Mapped controls (NIST, ISO 27001, CIS v8)
- ⚙️ Suggested countermeasures and detection logic

This project demonstrates my ability to think like a Financial Threat Intelligence Analyst, combining cyber + AML context with technical and strategic mitigation.
